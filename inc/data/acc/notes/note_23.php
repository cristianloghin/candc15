<p>Following shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting on 27 June 2012, where Interests under the Joint Share Ownership Plan have vested and if the participant is a continuing employee and so agrees, the participant is entitled to dividends on the relevant Plan Shares in proportion to his economic interest. The Trustees of the Employee Trust are entitled to the dividends otherwise but have waived their entitlement. In the year to 28 February 2015, dividends of €0.5m were paid to Plan participants (2014: €0.5m).</p>

<p>In the current financial year, as part of the Group’s capital management strategy, a subsidiary of the Group invested €30.0m in an on-market share buyback programme, purchasing 9,025,000 of the Company’s shares at an average price of €3.29. The Group’s UK stockbrokers, Investec, conducted the share repurchase programme. All shares acquired as part of the share buyback programme are held as treasury shares.

All shares held by Kleinwort Benson (Guernsey) Trustees Limited as trustees of the C&amp;C Employee Trust which were neither cancelled nor disposed of by the Trust at 28 February 2014 continue to be included in the treasury share reserve.</p>
<h4>Share premium - Group</h4>
<p>The change in legal parent of the Group on 30 April 2004, as disclosed in detail in that year’s annual report, was accounted for as a reverse acquisition. This transaction gave rise to a reverse acquisition reserve debit of €703.9m, which, for presentation purposes in the Group financial statements, has been netted against the share premium in the consolidated balance sheet.</p>
<h4>Share premium - Company</h4>
<p>The share premium, as stated in the Company balance sheet, represents the premium recognised on shares issued and amounts to €824.4m as at 28 February 2015 (2014: €817.7m). The current year movement relates to the exercise of share options and the issuance of a scrip dividend to those who elected to receive additional ordinary shares in place of a cash dividend.</p>
<h4>Capital redemption reserve and capital reserve</h4>
<p>These reserves initially arose on the conversion of preference shares into share capital of the Company and other changes and reorganisations of the Group’s capital structure. These reserves are not distributable.</p>
<h4>Cash flow hedging reserve</h4>
<p>The hedging reserve includes the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of cash flow hedging instruments related to hedged transactions that have not yet occurred together with any deferred gains or losses on hedging contracts where hedge accounting was discontinued but the forecast transaction was still anticipated to occur.</p>
<h4>Share-based payment reserve</h4>
<p>The reserve relates to amounts expensed in the income statement in connection with share option grants falling within the scope of IFRS 2 Share-Based Payment, plus amounts received from participants on award of Interests under the Group’s Joint Share Ownership Plan, less reclassifications to retained income following exercise/forfeit post vesting or lapse of such share options and Interests, as set out in note 4.</p>
<h4>Currency translation reserve</h4>
<p>The translation reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences from 1 March 2004, arising from the translation of the Group’s net investment in its non-euro denominated operations, including the translation of the profits of such operations from the average exchange rate for the year to the exchange rate at the balance sheet date, as adjusted for the translation of foreign currency borrowings designated as net investment hedges and long term intra group loans for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to happen in the foreseeable future, and as a consequence are deemed quasi equity in nature and are therefore part of the Group’s net investment in foreign operations.</p>
<h4>Revaluation reserve</h4>
<p>This reserve originally comprised the gain which arose on the revaluation of land by external valuers during the financial year ended 28 February 2009. A subsequent external valuation of freehold properties and plant &amp; machinery was completed as at 29 February 2012 and in the current financial year an external valuation was completed of the Group’s freehold properties in Clonmel, Wellpark and Shepton Mallet and of the Group’s plant &amp; machinery assets in Clonmel, Wellpark, Shepton Mallet and Vermont. </p>
<p>As a result of the valuation in the current financial year, the carrying value of land and buildings reduced by a net €1.7m; of which €7.0m was debited directly to the income statement and €5.3m was credited to the revaluation reserve. In addition the value of the Group’s plant &amp; machinery decreased by €3.5m as a result of the valuation and this was debited directly to the income statement.</p>
<p>As a result of the external valuation completed as at 29 February 2012 the carrying value of land was reduced by €3.4m; of which €3.0m was debited directly to this revaluation reserve to the extent that it reduced a previously recognised gain on the same asset and €0.4m to the income statement as there were no previously recognised gains in this revaluation reserve by which to offset. In addition, an increase in the carrying value of buildings in Glasgow of €1.3m was credited directly to the revaluation reserve as a result of this external valuation.</p>
<h4>Treasury shares</h4>
<p>Included in this reserve is where the Company issues equity share capital under its Joint Share Ownership Plan, which is held in trust by the Group’s Employee Trust. The consideration paid, 90% by a Group company and 10% by the participants, in respect of these shares is deducted from total shareholders’ equity and classified as treasury shares on consolidation until such time as the Interests vest and the participant acquires the shares from the Trust or the Interests lapse and the shares are cancelled or disposed of by the Trust. As outlined in further detail below, also included in the reserve in the current year is the purchase of 9,025,000 shares an average price of €3.29 per share under the Group’s share buyback programme.</p>
<h4>Capital management</h4>
<p>The Board’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to safeguard the Group’s ability: to continue as a going concern for the benefit of shareholders and stakeholders; to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence; and, to sustain the future development of the business through the optimisation of the value of its debt and equity shareholding balance.</p>
<p>The Board considers capital to comprise long-term debt and equity. There are no externally imposed requirements with respect to capital with the exception of a financial covenant in the Group’s debt facilities which limits the Net debt:EBITDA ratio to a maximum of 3.5 times. This financial covenant was complied with throughout the year.</p>
<p>The Board periodically reviews the capital structure of the Group, considering the cost of capital and the risks associated with each class of capital. The Board approves any material adjustments to the capital structure in terms of the relative proportions of debt and equity. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may issue new shares, dispose of assets to reduce debt, alter dividend policy by increasing or reducing the dividend paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders and/or buy back shares. In respect of the financial year ended 28 February 2015, the Company paid an interim dividend on ordinary shares of 4.5c per share (2014: 4.3c per share) and the Directors propose, subject to shareholder approval, that a final dividend of 7.0c per share (2014: 5.7c per share) be paid, bringing the total dividend for the year to 11.5c per share (2014: 10.0c per share).</p>
<p>In addition, as part of the Group’s capital management strategy, the Group participated in a share buyback programme during the financial year. A subsidiary of the Group invested €30.0m as part of this on-market share buyback programme, purchasing 9,025,000 of the Company’s shares at an average price of €3.29. The Group’s UK stockbrokers, Investec, conducted the share repurchase programme. All shares acquired as part of the share buyback programme are held as treasury shares. At the AGM held on 3 July 2014, shareholders granted the Group authority to make market purchases of up to 10% of its own shares.</p>
<p>The Group monitors debt capital on the basis of interest cover and by the ratio of Net debt:EBITDA before exceptional items. In December 2014, the Group updated and amended its committed €450m multi-currency 5 year syndicated revolving facility with 7 banks which is repayable in a single instalment on 22 December 2019.</p>
<h4>Company income statement</h4>
<p>In accordance with Section 148(8) of the Companies (Amendment) Act, 1963, the income statement of the Company has not been presented separately in these consolidated financial statements. A profit of €185.5m (2014: €4.9m loss) was recognised in the individual Company income statement of C&amp;C Group plc.</p>
