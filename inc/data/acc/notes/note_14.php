<p>Inventory write-down recognised as an expense within operating costs amounted to €4.3m (2014: €1.2m). The level of inventory write-down in the current financial year is impacted by the write-off of inventory in Australia following a change of the Group’s distributor and the write-off of packaging stocks in VHCC. The inventory write-down in the prior financial year was primarily as a result of the write-off of inventory work in progress (‘WIP’) and packaging stocks following the transfer of production of the Hornsby’s brand to the Vermont cidery, and the discontinuation of some flavoured Hornsby’s ciders on integrating the VHCC business with the Group’s existing US business. Previously impaired inventory recovered during the financial year and recognised as exceptional income (note 5) amounted to €0.3m (2014: €nil).</p>
