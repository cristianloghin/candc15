<h2>22. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT</h2>
<p>The Group’s multinational operations expose it to various financial risks in the ordinary course of business that include credit risk, liquidity risk, commodity price risk, currency risk and interest rate risk. This note discusses the Group’s exposure to each of these financial risks, summarises the risk management strategy for managing these risks and details the accounting treatment applied to the Group’s derivative financial instruments and hedging activities. The note is presented as follows:-</p>

	(f) Accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities
</p>
<h3>(a) Overview of the Group’s risk exposures and management strategy</h3>
<p>The most significant financial market risks that the Group is exposed to include foreign currency exchange rate risk, commodity price fluctuations, interest rate risk and financial counterparty creditworthiness. There has been no significant change during the financial year to either the financial risks faced by the Group or the Board’s approach to the management of these risks.</p>
<p>The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management framework. This is executed through various committees to which the Board has delegated appropriate levels of authority. An essential part of this framework is the role undertaken by the Audit Committee, supported by the internal audit function, and the Group Chief Financial Officer. The Board, through its Committees, has reviewed the internal control environment and the risk management systems and process for identifying and evaluating the significant risks affecting the business and the policies and procedures by which these risks will be managed effectively. The Board has embedded these structures and procedures throughout the Group and considers these to be a robust and efficient mechanism for creating a culture of risk awareness at every level of management.</p>
<p>The Group’s risk management programme seeks to minimise the potential adverse effects, arising from fluctuations in financial markets, on the Group’s financial performance in a non speculative manner at a reasonable cost when economically viable to do so. The Group achieves the management of these risks in part, where appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. All derivative financial contracts entered into in this regard are in liquid markets with credit rated parties. Treasury activities are performed within strict terms of reference that have been approved by the Board.</p>

<h3>Determination of Fair Value</h3>
<p>Set out below are the major methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities. There is no material difference between the fair value of financial assets and liabilities falling due within one year and their carrying amount as due to the short term maturity of these financial assets and liabilities their carrying amount is deemed to approximate fair value.</p>
<h5>Short term bank deposits and cash &amp; cash equivalents</h5>
<p>The nominal amount of all short-term bank deposits and cash &amp; cash equivalents is deemed to reflect fair value at the balance sheet date.</p>
<h5>Advances to customers</h5>
<p>The nominal amount of all advances to customers, after provision for impairment, is considered to reflect fair value.</p>
<h5>Trade &amp; other receivables/payables</h5>
<p>The nominal amount of all trade &amp; other receivables/payables after provision for impairment is deemed to reflect fair value at the balance sheet date with the exception of provisions and amounts due from Group undertakings after more than one year which are discounted to fair value.</p>
<h5>Derivatives (forward currency contracts, put/call options in equity accounted investees)</h5>
<p>The fair values of forward currency contracts, put/call options and interest rate swaps are based on market price calculations using financial models.</p>
<p>The Group has adopted the following fair value measurement hierarchy for financial instruments that are measured in the balance sheet at fair value:</p>
<ul class="list">
	<li>
		Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.<br>
		<br>
		The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (e.g. over the counter derivatives) are determined using valuation techniques. These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates.<br>
		<br>
	</li>	
	<li>
		Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs that have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).<br>
		<br>
		The carrying values of any forward currency contracts held by the Group would be based on fair values arrived at using Level 2 inputs. There were no outstanding forward currency contracts held by the Group as at 28 February 2015 or 28 February 2014.<br>
		<br>
		As set out further in note 13, as part of the Group’s joint venture agreement in Thistle Pub Company Limited with Maclay Group plc during the financial year ended 28 February 2013, the Group granted Thistle Pub Company Limited and Maclay Group plc a call option enabling either of them to purchase the Group’s share of equity at a fixed price at any time in the first 15 years after the date the joint venture was formed, resulting in the recognition of a €0.2m financial liability. The carrying value of the option is valued based on Level 3 inputs, with the fair value being arrived at through the use of a Black-Scholes model. The movement in the fair value of this derivative to 28 February 2015 was less than €0.1m.<br>
		<br>
		Applying sensitivities to the key input assumptions used in valuing the above derivative financial instruments would not have a material impact on the carrying value of the derivative financial instruments or on the income statement.<br>
		<br>
	</li>
</ul>
<h5>Interest bearing loans &amp; borrowings</h5>
<p>The nominal amount of interest bearing loans &amp; borrowings is deemed to reflect fair value at 28 February 2015 due to the close proximity of draw down to the year end date.</p>
<h3>(c) Market risk</h3>
<p>Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as commodity prices, foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the Group’s income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.</p>
<p>The Group enters into derivative financial contracts, when deemed economically viable to do so, to mitigate risks arising in the ordinary course of business from foreign exchange rate and interest rate movements, and also incurs financial liabilities, in order to manage these market risks. The Group carries out all such transactions within the Treasury policy as set down by the Board of Directors.</p>
<h4>Commodity price risk</h4>
<p>The Group is exposed to variability in the price of commodities used in the production or in the packaging of finished products, such as barley, sugar, apple concentrate and aluminium. Commodity price risk is managed, where economically viable, through fixed price contracts with suppliers incorporating appropriate commodity hedging and pricing mechanisms. The Group does not directly enter into commodity hedge contracts. The cost of production is also sensitive to variability in the price of energy, primarily gas and electricity. It is Group policy to fix the cost of a certain level of its energy requirement through fixed price contractual arrangements directly with its energy suppliers.</p>
<h4>Currency risk</h4>
<p>The Company’s functional and reporting currency and that of its share capital is euro. The euro is also the Group’s reporting currency and the currency used for all planning and budgetary purposes. The Group is exposed to currency risk in relation to sales and purchase transactions by Group companies in currencies other than their functional currency (transaction risk), and fluctuations in the euro value of the Group’s net investment in foreign currency (sterling and US dollar) denominated subsidiary undertakings (translation risk). Currency exposures for the entire Group are managed and controlled centrally.</p>
<p>The Group seeks to minimise its foreign currency transaction exposure when economically viable by maximising the value of its foreign currency input costs and creating a natural hedge. Group policy is to manage its remaining net exposure by hedging a portion of the projected non-euro forecast sales revenue up to a maximum of two years ahead. Forward foreign currency contracts are used to manage this risk. The Group does not enter into such derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. All such derivative contracts entered into are in liquid markets with credit-approved counterparties. Treasury operations are controlled within strict terms of reference that have been approved by the Board.</p>
<p>In addition, the Group has a number of long term US dollar and sterling intra group loans for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to happen in the foreseeable future, and as a consequence of which are deemed quasi equity in nature and are therefore part of the Group’s net investment in its foreign operations. The Group does not hedge the translation exposure arising on the translation of the profits of foreign currency subsidiaries.</p>
<p>The net currency gains and losses on transactional currency exposures are recognised in the income statement and the changes arising from fluctuations in the euro value of the Group’s net investment in foreign operations are reported separately within other comprehensive income.</p>

<p>The Group and Company’s exposure to interest rate risk arises principally from its long-term debt obligations. It is Group policy to manage interest cost and exposure to market risk centrally by using interest rate swaps, where deemed appropriate, to give the desired mix of fixed and floating rate debt. The Group has no outstanding interest rate swap contracts at 28 February 2015 or 28 February 2014.</p>
<h4>Financial instruments: Cash flow hedges</h4>
<p>The Group had no outstanding derivatives as at 28 February 2015 or 28 February 2014.</p>
<h3>(d) Credit risk</h3>
<p>Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Group’s trade receivables, its cash advances to customers, cash &amp; cash equivalents including deposits with banks and derivative financial instruments contracted with banks. The Group has an indirect exposure to European Sovereigns via its defined benefit pension scheme investment portfolio. In the context of the Group’s operations, credit risk is mainly influenced by the individual characteristics of individual counterparties and is not considered particularly concentrated as it primarily arises from a wide and varied customer base; there are no material dependencies or concentrations of individual customers which would warrant disclosure under IFRS 8 Operating Segments.</p>
<p>The Group has detailed procedures for monitoring and managing the credit risk related to its trade receivables and advances to customers based on experience, customer track records and historic default rates. Generally, individual ‘risk limits’ are set by customer and risk is only accepted above such limits in defined circumstances. A strict credit assessment is made of all new applicants who request credit-trading terms. The utilisation and revision, where appropriate, of credit limits is regularly monitored. Impairment provision accounts are used to record impairment losses unless the Group is satisfied that no recovery of the amount owing is possible. At that point, the amount is considered irrecoverable and is written off directly against the trade receivable. The Group also manages credit risk through the use of a receivables purchase arrangement, for an element of its trade receivables. Under the terms of this arrangement, the Group transfers the credit risk, late payment risk and control of the receivables sold. The total receivables sold at 28 February 2015 was €21.4m.</p>
<p>Advances to customers are generally secured by, amongst others, rights over property or intangible assets, such as the right to take possession of the premises of the customer. Interest rates calculated on repayment/annuity advances are generally based on the risk-free rate plus a margin, which takes into account the risk profile of the customer and value of security given. The Group establishes an allowance for impairment of customers advances that represents its estimate of potential future losses.</p>
<p>From time to time, the Group holds significant cash balances, which are invested on a short-term basis and disclosed under cash &amp; cash equivalents in the balance sheet. Risk of counterparty default arising on short term cash deposits is controlled within a framework of dealing primarily with banks who are members of the Group’s banking syndicate, and by limiting the credit exposure to any one of these banks or institutions. Management does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations.</p>
<p>The Company also bears credit risk in relation to amounts owed by Group undertakings and from guarantees provided in respect of the liabilities of wholly owned subsidiaries as disclosed in note 25.</p>
<p>The carrying amount of financial assets, net of impairment provisions represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was:-</p>

<p>The ageing of trade receivables and advances to customers together with an analysis of movement in the Group impairment provisions against these receivables are disclosed in note 15. The Group does not have any significant concentrations of risk.</p>
<h3>(e) Liquidity risk</h3>
<p>Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group or Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. Liquid resources are defined as the total of cash &amp; cash equivalents. The Group finances its operations through cash generated by the business and medium term bank credit facilities; the Group does not use off-balance sheet special purpose entities as a source of liquidity or financing.</p>
<p>The Group’s policy is to ensure that sufficient resources are available either from cash balances, cash flows or committed bank facilities to meet all debt obligations as they fall due. To achieve this, the Group (a) maintains adequate cash or cash equivalent balances; (b) prepares detailed 3 year cash projections; and (c) keeps refinancing options under review. In addition, the Group maintains an overdraft facility that is unsecured.</p>
<p>In December 2014, the Group updated and amended its committed €450m multi-currency five year syndicated revolving loan facility with seven banks, namely Bank of Ireland, Bank of Scotland, Barclays Bank, Danske Bank, HSBC, Rabobank, and Ulster Bank, repayable in a single instalment on 22 December 2019. The facility agreement provides for a further €100m in the form of an uncommitted accordion facility and permits the Group to avail of further financial indebtedness, excluding working capital and guarantee facilities, to a maximum value of €150m, subject to agreeing the terms and conditions with the lenders. Consequently the Group is permitted under the terms of the agreement, to have debt capacity of €700m of which €342.8m was drawn at 28 February 2015 (2014: €309.6m was drawn under the Group’s 2012 multi-currency facility). This 5 year multi-currency facility replaces the Group’s previous multi-currency facility which was negotiated in February 2012 and which was due to mature in February 2017.</p>
<p>The Group’s debt facility incorporates two financial covenants:</p>
<ul class="list">
	<li>Interest cover: The ratio of EBITDA to net interest for a period of 12 months ending on each half year date will not be less than 3.5:1</li>
	<li>Net debt/EBITDA: The ratio of net debt on each half year date to EBITDA for a period of 12 months ending on a half year date will not exceed 3.5:1</li>
</ul>
<p>Compliance with these debt covenants is monitored continuously.</p>
<p>The Group’s main liquidity risk relates to maturing debt, however this risk is considered low at year end given the negotiation of a new five year committed facility in December 2014 as outlined above. </p>
<p>At the year end, the Group had net debt, net of unamortised issue costs, of €157.8m, with a Net debt/ EBITDA ratio of 1.1:1.</p>
<p>The following are the contractual maturities of financial liabilities, including interest payments and derivatives and excluding the impact of netting arrangements:-</p>

<p>Derivatives are initially recorded at fair value on the date the contract is entered into and subsequently re-measured to fair value at reporting dates. The gain or loss arising on re-measurement is recognised in the income statement except where the instrument is a designated hedging instrument under the cash flow hedging model.</p>
<h4>Cash flow hedges</h4>
<p>The Group, when appropriate, also enters into forward exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges to manage short term foreign currency exposures to expected future sales. There were no outstanding contracts as at 28 February 2015 and 28 February 2014.</p>
<p>In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the Group is required to document the relationship between the item being hedged and the hedging instrument and demonstrate, at inception, that the hedge relationship will be highly effective on an ongoing basis. The hedge relationship must also be tested for effectiveness retrospectively and prospectively on subsequent reporting dates.</p>
<p>Gains and losses on cash flow hedges that are determined to be highly effective are recognised in other comprehensive income and then reflected in a cash flow hedging reserve within equity to the extent that they are actually effective. When the related forecasted transaction occurs, the deferred gains or losses are reclassified from other comprehensive income to the income statement. Ineffective portions of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument are recognised immediately in the income statement.</p>
<p>The Group ordinarily seeks to apply the hedge accounting model to all forward currency contracts.</p-->
