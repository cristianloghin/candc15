<p>Goodwill consists both of goodwill capitalised under Irish GAAP which at the transition date to IFRS was treated as deemed cost and goodwill that arose on the acquisition of businesses since that date which was capitalised at cost and subsequently at fair value and represents the synergies arising from cost savings and the opportunity to utilise the extended distribution network of the Group to leverage the marketing of acquired products.</p>
<p>In line with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, goodwill is allocated to each operating segment (which may comprise more than one cash generating unit) which is expected to benefit from the combination synergies. These operating segments represent the lowest level within the Group at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.</p>
<p>All goodwill is regarded as having an indefinite life and is not subject to amortisation under IFRS but is subject to an annual impairment assessment.</p>

<p>Capitalised brands include the Tennent’s beer brands and the Gaymers cider brands acquired during the financial year ended 28 February 2010, the Hornsby’s cider brand acquired during the year ended 29 February 2012 and the VHCC cider brands and Waverley wine brands acquired during the financial year ended 28 February 2013.</p>
<p>During the prior financial year, the Group disposed of two high strength cider brands, Diamond White and White Star, for a nominal amount. These brands were originally acquired as part of the Gaymers cider business during the financial year ended 28 February 2010, no value was assigned to these brands on acquisition.</p>
<p>The Tennent’s, Gaymers and VHCC brands were valued at fair value on the date of acquisition in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 3 (2004) Business Combinations by independent professional valuers. The Hornsby’s cider brand and Waverley wine brands were valued at cost.</p>
<p>Capitalised brands are regarded as having indefinite useful economic lives and therefore have not been amortised. The brands are protected by trademarks, which are renewable indefinitely in all major markets where they are sold and it is the Group’s policy to support them with the appropriate level of brand advertising. In addition, there are not believed to be any legal, regulatory or contractual provisions that limit the useful lives of these brands. Accordingly, the Directors believe that it is appropriate that the brands be treated as having indefinite lives for accounting purposes.</p>
<p>No intangible assets were acquired by way of government grant, there is no title restriction on any of the capitalised intangible assets and no intangible assets are pledged as security. There are no contractual commitments in relation to the acquisition of intangible assets at year end.</p>

<p>Other intangible assets comprise the fair value of trade relationships acquired as part of the acquisition of Wallaces Express during the current financial year, the Gleeson trade relationships acquired during the prior financial year and 20 year distribution rights for third party beer products acquired as part of the acquisition of the Tennent’s business during the financial year ended 28 February 2010. These were valued at fair value on the date of acquisition in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 3 (2004) Business Combinations by independent professional valuers. The intangible assets have a finite life and are subject to amortisation on a straight line basis. The amortisation charge for the year ended 28 February 2015 with respect to intangible assets was €0.3m (2014: €0.2m).</p>
<h3>Impairment testing</h3>
<p>To ensure that goodwill and brands considered to have an indefinite useful economic life are not carried at above their recoverable amount, impairment reviews are performed comparing the carrying value of the assets with their recoverable amount using value-in-use computations. Impairment testing is performed annually or more frequently if there is an indication that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Where the value in use exceeds the carrying value of the asset, the asset is not impaired.</p>
<p>As permitted by IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, the value of the Group’s intangible assets (goodwill and brands) has been allocated to groups of cash generating units (referred to in this note as a business segment), which are not larger than an operating segment determined in accordance with IFRS 8 Operating Segments. These business segments represent the lowest levels within the Group at which the associated goodwill and indefinite life brands are monitored for management purposes.</p>
<p>The recoverable amount is calculated in respect of each business segment using value-in-use computations based on estimated future cash flows discounted to present value using a discount rate appropriate to each cash generating unit and terminal values calculated on the assumption that cash flows continue in perpetuity.</p>
<p>The key assumptions used in the value-in-use computations are:-</p>
<ul class="list">
	<li>Expected volume, net revenue and operating profit growth rates - cash flows for each business segment are based on detailed financial budgets and plans, formally approved by the Board, for years one to three; these cash flows are extrapolated out for years four and five;</li>
	<li>Long term growth rate - cash flows after the first five years were extrapolated using a long term growth rate, on the assumption that cash flows for the first five years will increase at a nominal growth rate in perpetuity,</li>
	<li>Discount rate.</li>
</ul>
<p>The key assumptions were based on management assessment of anticipated market conditions for each business segment. A terminal growth rate of between 2.0%-2.5% (2014: 2.5%-3.0%) in perpetuity was assumed based on an assessment of the likely long term growth prospects for the sectors and geographies in which the Group operates. The resulting cash flows were discounted to present value using a range of discount rates between 8%-10% (2014: 8%-10%); these rates are in line with the Group’s estimated pre-tax weighted average cost of capital for the three main geographies in which the Group operates (Ireland, Great Britain and North America), arrived at using the Capital Asset Pricing Model.</p>
<p>In formulating the budget and three year plan the Group takes into account historical experience, an appreciation of its core strengths and weaknesses in the markets in which it operates and external factors such as macro economic factors, inflation expectations by geography, regulation and expected changes in regulation (such as expected changes to duty rates and minimum pricing), market growth rates, sales price trend, competitor activity, market share targets and strategic plans and initiatives.</p>
<p>The Group has performed the detailed impairment testing calculations by business segment with the following discount rates being applied:</p>

<p>The impairment testing carried out during the year led to an impairment charge of €150.0m (2014: €nil) to the North American business segment. This impairment charge has resulted in a write-down of the carrying value of the brands of €73.8m and goodwill of €76.2m.  Competitive intensity increased markedly in the US market during the current financial year, with new entrants from global and domestic brewers and a growing craft cider movement. As a consequence the Group’s share of the category has come under pressure and this has led to the rebasing of the Group’s profit expectations, and terminal growth rate for the US business which has resulted in the impairment charge in the current financial year. All other segments had sufficient headroom.</p>
<h3>Sensitivity analysis</h3>
<p>The impairment testing carried out at 28 February 2015 identified headroom in the recoverable amount of the brands and goodwill compared to their carrying values in all business segments excluding North America. The testing identified an impairment charge in North America of €150.0m. The carrying value of the North America segment is the Directors’ estimate of its recoverable amount after the impairment charge. Any variation to the input assumptions would result in a further impairment charge.</p>
<p>The key sensitivities for the impairment testing are net revenue and operating profit growth assumptions, discount rates applied to the resulting cashflows and the expected long term growth rates. The impairment testing carried out at 28 February 2015 identified headroom in the recoverable amount of the brands and goodwill compared to their carrying values in all business segments.</p>
<p>The value in use calculations indicate significant headroom in respect of the Ireland and Scotland operating segments. In the case of C&amp;C Brands, the level of headroom, while significantly less than the headroom in the Ireland and Scotland operating segments, is in excess of €50.0m. No reasonable movement in any of the underlying assumptions would result in an impairment in the Ireland, Scotland, C&amp;C Brands or Export business segments.</p>
