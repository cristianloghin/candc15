		<div>The Group’s reporting currency is the euro but it transacts in foreign currencies and consolidates the results of non-euro reporting foreign operations. Fluctuations in value between the euro and these currencies may affect the Group’s revenues, costs and operating profits.</div>
		<div>The Group seeks to mitigate currency risks, where appropriate, through hedging and structured financial contracts to hedge a portion of its foreign currency transaction exposure. It has not entered into structured financial contracts to hedge its translation exposure on its foreign acquisitions.</div>

		<div>The solvency of the Group’s defined benefit pension schemes may be affected by a fall in the value of their investments, market and interest rate volatility and other economic and demographic factors. Each of these factors may require the Group to increase its contribution levels.</div>
		<div>The Group seeks to mitigate this risk by continuous monitoring, taking professional advice on the optimisation of asset returns within agreed acceptable risk tolerances and implementing liability-management initiatives such as the reduction in member contractual benefits approved by the Pensions Board in February 2012.</div>
