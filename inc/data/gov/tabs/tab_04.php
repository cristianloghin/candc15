			<p>The C&amp;C Profit Sharing Scheme is an all-employee share scheme and has two parts. Part A relates to employees in ROI and has been approved by the Irish Revenue Commissioners (the Irish APSS). Part B relates to employees in the UK and is a HMRC qualifying plan of free, partnership, matching or dividend shares (or cash dividends) with a minimum three year vesting period for matching shares (the UK SIP). UK resident executive Directors are eligible to participate in Part B only.</p>
			<p>There is currently no equivalent plan for Directors resident outside of Ireland or the UK.</p>
