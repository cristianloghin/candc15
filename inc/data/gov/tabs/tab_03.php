			<p>Subject to shareholder approval at the 2015 AGM, a new Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP 2015”) and a new Executive Share Option Scheme (“ESOS 2015”) will be adopted. Awards will not be granted under the new arrangements until FY2017.</p>
			<p>Subject to the plan limits set out below the Committee has the discretion to determine the appropriate mix of LTIP 2015 and ESOS 2015 awards each year in the context of the Company’s business cycle and its future growth plans save where the executive has a contractual entitlement. Malus and clawback provisions will apply to both the LTIP 2015 and the ESOS 2015. See the “Malus and clawback” section below for more details.</p>
			<p>Options/awards will be granted under the existing ESOS and the LTIP (Part I) in FY2016 (see Implementation section below).</p>
			<p>Awards are usually made annually by the Committee following the release of full year financial results but can be made after release of the interim results and exceptionally at other times.</p>

		<div>If awards are made under both the LTIP 2015 and the ESOS 2015 in respect of the same financial year the overall maximum, other than in exceptional circumstances, will be capped at 250% of salary. In exceptional circumstances the maximum combined LTIP 2015 and ESOS 2015 award in respect of any financial year is 500% of salary.</div>

		<div>The vesting of awards is subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions set by the Committee. Performance conditions are selected that are aligned to the Company’s strategy and with shareholders’ interests. The performance measures chosen are reviewed regularly to ensure they remain relevant. The relevant measures, targets and weightings may vary each year based upon the Company’s priorities. Options lapse if the performance target threshold is not met in the relevant testing period and there is no retesting.</div>

			<p>The Committee may grant options to acquire shares in the Company at a market related exercise price. The Committee has discretion to grant ESOS 2015 awards to reward sustained value creation by averaging the value of the shares at grant and the point of exercise across an extended period of up to six months.</p>
			<p>The vesting of options is subject to meeting a specific performance target set by the Committee and measured over a period of three years. Options will not normally be exercisable until after the assessment of the performance condition following the end of the performance period.</p>
			<p>Early vesting may be available for certain qualifying leavers. See policy on payment for loss of office further down for more details.</p>
			<p>Options vest early on a change of control (or other relevant event), taking into account the performance conditions. Options may be adjusted in the event of a variation of share capital in accordance with the scheme rules.</p>
			<p>The Committee has the discretion to grant ESOS and ESOS 2015 options as tax-advantaged options as permitted by the UK Revenue authorities and allows grants of options over shares with a market value of up to the value prescribed by the applicable tax legislation (currently £30,000) to be made on a tax efficient basis to employees who are UK taxpayers. Tax-advantaged options will be subject to the same performance conditions as non-tax-advantaged ESOS options.</p>

			<p>The maximum ESOS 2015 award is 150% of base salary in respect of any financial year if granted in combination with a LTIP 2015 award equal to 100% of salary.</p>

			<p>Contractual entitlements to be granted in FY2016 under the current ESOS are:<br>

			<p>Under the LTIP (Part I) awards are granted in the form of nominal cost options to acquire shares or conditional awards. Under the LTIP 2015, awards of conditional shares, restricted stock or nil cost or nominal cost options (or similar cash equivalent) can be made.</p>

			<p>The Committee may decide that a participant has a right to ‘dividend equivalents’ whereby the participant receives additional value equivalent to that which accrues to shareholders by way of dividends that would have been paid on the underlying shares during the vesting period.

			<p>Early or pro-rata vesting may be available for certain qualifying leavers. See policy on payment for loss of office further down for more details.</p>
