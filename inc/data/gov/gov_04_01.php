	<p>Dear Shareholder</p>
	<p>On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Report on Directors’ remuneration for the financial year ended 28 February 2015. This follows a similar format to last year, when we chose to apply the 2013 UK regulations on remuneration disclosure on a voluntary basis. We will again be submitting both the Policy Report and the Annual Report on Remuneration to shareholders for an advisory vote at the Company’s 2015 AGM. We are also asking shareholders to approve the adoption of new share incentive plans, as our current ones expire within 12 months. Our Policy Report has been updated to reflect the provisions of the new share plans. Last year our advisory votes achieved the support of over 99.98% for the Annual Report on Remuneration and 92.72% for the Directors’ Remuneration Policy of the votes cast and we hope that shareholders will demonstrate their support again this year for all of our remuneration related resolutions.</p>

	<h2>FY2015 key decisions and incentive out-turn</h2>
	<p>The Board remain committed to a responsible approach to executive pay. During the year ended 28 February 2015 the Committee reviewed executive remuneration, however the executive Directors did not consider it appropriate to take a salary increase in FY2015 and this was supported by the Committee. The Committee feels it is important to observe that the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Finance Officer have not received a salary increase since November 2008 having waived their contractual entitlement to indexation increases in 2009 and 2010. They waived bonus payments in 2009 and in FY2014 they also waived share awards in order to facilitate larger awards to be made to a wider audience. Similarly no increase was made in the year to non-executive Director fees nor has any increase been made to these fees since 2008.</p>
	<p>As set out on further down, no bonus was paid to the executive Directors for FY2015. The Committee further determined that in respect of awards made in FY2012 under the C&amp;C Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS) and the C&amp;C Long Term Incentive Plan (Part I) (LTIP (Part I)), the performance conditions were not met and the awards did not vest.</p>
	<p>In addition the Committee approved various share awards and the principles of the FY2016 bonus scheme.</p>
	<!---->
	<h2>FY2016 arrangements</h2>
	<p>The Committee considered a salary increase for the executive Directors for FY2016 but the executive Directors, as part of their on-going commitment to, and investment in the business, did not consider it appropriate to take an increase, which was supported by the Committee. Variable pay awards will be unchanged from the prior year with the same overall maximum awards under the ESOS and LTIP (Part I) and, except for awards to be made under the ESOS, the same performance conditions attaching as in FY2015. For the ESOS awards we will apply a vesting schedule with straight line vesting between a threshold EPS target of 3% and a maximum EPS target of 6%, replacing the cliff vesting of prior years.</p>
	<p>Shareholders are also being asked to approve the extension of the exercise period of the LTIP (Part I). Currently the rules of this Scheme are drafted such that executives have a six month window in which to exercise options vesting under the LTIP (Part I). If the executives are prohibited from exercising their options because the Company is in a close period, then the options will lapse. This is not the intention of the Scheme which should allow for the exercise period to be extended in this situation and we are therefore seeking to amend the rules to provide this flexibility by extending this window from six months to three years from vesting.</p>
	<!---->
	<h2>Looking forward to FY2017</h2>
	<p>The Committee has consulted with major shareholders on the implementation of new incentive arrangements and these include the adoption of a new Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP 2015”) and a new Executive Share Option Scheme (“ESOS 2015”). Awards will not be granted under the new arrangements until FY2017, however we have summarised the key provisions in the Policy Report. The detailed terms of the new arrangements are set out in the AGM Notice. The new share schemes have been designed to:</p>
	<ul class="list">
		<li>take account of the changes to the Group’s business model and to support our business strategy;</li>
		<li>reflect our stakeholder philosophy and entrepreneurial culture; and</li>
		<li>provide a flexible framework that is perceived as valuable, a fair reflection of performance and which is aligned with sustainable shareholder value creation.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Under the proposed framework, the Committee can make an annual LTIP 2015 award up to 150% of salary (where no ESOS 2015 award is granted in respect of the same financial year) or alternatively the Committee can make annual grants under both the LTIP 2015 and ESOS 2015, subject to the plan limits set out in the Directors’ remuneration policy. This gives the Committee the flexibility, recognising the entrepreneurial culture of the business, to determine the appropriate mix of LTIP 2015 and ESOS 2015 awards each year in the context of the Company’s business cycle and its future growth plans.</p>
	<p>The first awards will not be made until FY2017 and we will therefore be considering appropriate performance conditions closer to the time of grant. The current intention is for awards for executive Directors under the LTIP 2015 to be subject to a combination of EPS, a return based measure and cash conversion performance conditions and for the awards under the ESOS 2015 to be subject to a specific performance target. In addition:</p>
	<ul class="list">
		<li>the threshold level of vesting under the LTIP 2015 will be reduced from 30% to 25%;</li>
		<li>flexibility has been included in the Remuneration Policy to introduce a deferred share element to the annual bonus;</li>
		<li>a shareholding guideline will be introduced for the current executive directors. The Chief Executive Officer will be expected to maintain a personal shareholding of at least two times salary. For the other executive directors this will be set at one times salary; and</li>
		<li>malus and clawback provisions will be included on all variable remuneration in line with the new UK Corporate Governance Code with effect from 1 March 2016.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The Committee believes these changes are in the best interests of the Company and fully support the execution of the C&amp;C Group plc strategy and stakeholder ethos.</p>

<p class="large">Introduction</p>
<h2>Committee and Advisers</h2>
<h3>Composition</h3>
<p>The Committee of the Board consists solely of independent non-executive Directors.</p>
<p>During the year ended 28 February 2015 the Chairman of the Committee was Breege O’Donoghue. Other members of the Committee were Richard Holroyd and Stewart Gilliland.</p>
<!---->
<h3>Terms of reference of Committee</h3>
<p>The Committee’s terms of reference are summarised on <a href="corporate-governance/director-statement-governance.html">here</a>.</p>
<!---->
<h3>Advice and Consultation</h3>
<p>The Chairman of the Board and the Chief Executive Officer are fully consulted on remuneration proposals but neither is present when his own remuneration is discussed.</p>
<p>The Committee has access to external advice from remuneration consultants on compensation when necessary. During the year ended 28 February 2015 the Committee obtained advice from Deloitte who were appointed by the Committee. Deloitte provided advice in relation to the changes to the executive long-term incentive schemes, the Joint Share Ownership Plan, the Directors’ remuneration report and the Directors’ remuneration policy. Deloitte’s fees for this advice amounted to €30,888 charged on a time or fixed fee basis. During the period, separate divisions of Deloitte advised the Group on commercial contract issues and tax issues.</p>
<p>Deloitte is a member of the UK Remuneration Consultants Group and, as such, voluntarily operates under a code of conduct. To safeguard objectivity, protocols are established to cover the basis for contact with executive management and to avoid potential conflict arising from other client relationships. The Committee is satisfied that the remuneration advice provided by Deloitte is objective and independent.</p>
<p>The Committee has also obtained advice from:</p>
<ul class="list">
	<li>David Johnston, Company Secretary (appointed with effect from 17 November 2014)</li>
	<li>Paul Walker, Company Secretary and General Counsel (stepped down from the role on 1 August 2014)</li>
	<li>Sarah Riley, Group Director of Human Resources.</li>
</ul>
<p>No Director is present when their own remuneration is discussed.</p>
<!---->
<h2>Shareholders’ Views</h2>
<p>The Committee is committed to open and transparent dialogue with shareholders and consults with shareholders and governance bodies on proposals relating to remuneration structures. During the year, the Committee consulted with, and received good support from, significant shareholders regarding the new executive long-term incentive schemes.</p>
<!---->
<p class="large">Directors’ Remuneration Policy</p>
<p>This part of the report sets out the Group’s policy on Directors’ remuneration. The policy has been determined by the Committee of the Board of Directors (“the Committee”). The Directors’ remuneration policy will be subject to an advisory vote at the 2015 AGM and will take effect from that date.</p>
<!---->
<h2>General statement of policy</h2>
<p>The main aim of the Group’s policy on Directors’ remuneration is to attract, retain and motivate Directors of the calibre required to promote the long-term success of the Group. The Committee therefore seeks to ensure that Directors are properly, but not excessively, remunerated and motivated to perform in the best interests of shareholders, commensurate with ensuring shareholder value.</p>
<p>The Committee seeks to ensure that executive Directors’ remuneration is aligned with shareholders’ interests and the Group’s strategy. Share awards are therefore seen as the principal method of long-term incentivisation. Executive Directors are incentivised on a range of equity share structures, notably the significant share ownership held by Stephen Glancey and Kenny Neison through the Joint Share Ownership Plan. Similar principles are applied for senior management, several of whom have material equity holdings in the Company.</p>
<p>Annual performance-related rewards aligned with the Group’s key financial, operational and strategic goals and based on stretching targets are a further component of the total executive remuneration package. For senior management, mechanisms are tailored to local requirements.</p>
<p>The Group seeks to bring transparency to executive Directors’ reward structures through the use of cash allowances in place of benefits in kind. In setting executive Directors’ remuneration the Committee has regard to pay levels and conditions applicable to other employees across the Group.</p>

	require_once('inc/data/gov/tabs/tab_10.php');
?>
<!---->
<h3>Malus and clawback</h3>
<p>In line with the recently updated UK Corporate Governance Code malus and clawback provisions will apply to all elements of performance-based variable remuneration (i.e. annual bonus, ESOS 2015 and LTIP 2015) for the executive Directors with effect from 1 March 2016. The circumstances in which malus and clawback will be applied are if there has been in the opinion of the Committee a material mis-statement of the Group’s published accounts; or the Committee reasonably determines that a participant has been guilty of gross misconduct. The clawback provisions will apply for a period of two years following the end of the performance period.</p>
<!---->
<h3>Payments under the LTIP (Part I)</h3>
<p>At the 2015 AGM, shareholders are being asked to approve a resolution extending the exercise period of the LTIP (Part I). Currently the rules of the Plan are drafted such that executives have a six month window in which to exercise options vesting under the LTIP (Part I). If the executives are prohibited from exercising their options because the Company is in a close period, then the options will lapse. This is not the intention of the Plan, which should allow for the exercise period to be extended in this situation and we are therefore seeking to amend the rules to provide this flexibility by extending this window from six months to three years from vesting.</p>
<!---->
<h2>Discretion to depart from policy</h2>
<h3>Share schemes and other incentives</h3>
<p>The Committee recognises the importance of ensuring that the outcomes of the Group’s executive pay arrangements properly reflect the Group’s overall performance over the performance period. It is the Committee’s intention that the mechanistic application of performance conditions relating to awards will routinely be reviewed to avoid outcomes which could be seen as contrary to shareholders’ expectations.</p>
<p>To the extent provided for in accordance with any relevant amendment power under the rules of the share plans or in the terms of any performance condition, the Committee may alter the performance conditions relating to an award or option already granted if an event occurs (such as a material acquisition or divestment or unexpected event) which the Committee reasonably considers means that the performance conditions would not, without alteration, achieve their original purpose. The Committee will act fairly and reasonably in making the alteration so that the performance conditions achieve their original purpose and the thresholds remain as challenging as originally imposed. The Committee will explain and disclose any such alteration in the next remuneration report.</p>
<!---->
<h3>Legacy payments</h3>
<p>The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration payment or any payment for loss of office without the need to consult with shareholders or seek their approval, notwithstanding that it is not in line with the policy set out above, where the terms of the payment were agreed either:</p>
<ul class="list">
	<li>before the policy came into effect; or</li>
	<li>at a time when the relevant individual was not a Director of the Company and, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming a Director of the Company.</li>
</ul>
<p>For these purposes: the term ‘payment’ includes any award of variable remuneration; in relation to an award over shares, the terms of the payment are ‘agreed’ at the time the award is granted.</p>
<!---->
<h3>Minor changes</h3>
<p>The Committee may, without the need to consult with shareholders or seek their approval, make minor changes to this Policy to aid in its operation or implementation taking into account the interests of shareholders.</p>
<!---->
<h2>Comparison with remuneration policy for employees generally</h2>
<p>Remuneration packages for executive Directors and for employees as a whole reflect the same general remuneration principle that individuals should be rewarded on their contribution to the Group and its success, and the reward they receive should be competitive in the market in which they operate without paying more than is necessary to recruit and retain them.</p>
<p>The remuneration package for executive Directors reflects their role of leading the strategic development of the Group. Accordingly there is a strong alignment with shareholders’ interests, through long term performance-based share rewards. Senior management are similarly rewarded.</p>
<p>These rewards are not appropriate for all employees but it is the Committee’s policy that employees in general should be afforded an opportunity to participate in the Group’s success through holding shares in the Company through all-employee schemes.</p>
<p>Executive Directors are incentivised through an annual cash bonus to achieve shorter term objectives and all employees are similarly incentivised.</p>
<p>For executive Directors the remuneration package reflects the demands of a global market. For employees generally remuneration and reward are tailored to the local market in which they work. It is the Committee’s policy that all employees should share in the success of the business divisions towards whose success they have contributed.</p>
<!---->
<h2>Consideration of employment conditions generally and consultation with employees</h2>
<p>As described above, when setting the policy for executive Directors’ remuneration, the Committee applies the same core principle as applied for the pay and employment conditions of other Group employees. When reviewing Directors’ remuneration, the Committee has regard to the outcome of pay reviews for employees as a whole.</p>
<p>The Committee did not directly consult with employees when formulating the Directors’ remuneration policy set out in this report and no remuneration comparison measurements comparing executive Directors remuneration with employees generally were used.</p>
<p>The Group has regular contact with employee representatives on matters of pay and remuneration for employees covered by collective bargaining or consultation arrangements.</p>
<!---->
<h2>ILLUSTRATION OF REMUNERATION POLICY</h2>
<p>The charts below show the level of remuneration and the relative split of remuneration between fixed pay (base salary, benefits and cash allowance in lieu of pension) and variable pay (annual bonus, ESOS and LTIP (Part I)) for each executive Director on the basis of minimum remuneration, remuneration receivable for performance in line with the Company’s expectations and maximum remuneration (not allowing for any share price appreciation).</p>

<h3>Bases and Assumptions</h3>
<p>For the purposes of the above charts, the following assumptions have been made:</p>
<ul class="list">
	<li>Base salary is the salary as at 1 March 2015.</li>
	<li>Benefits as disclosed in the single figure table on page 81 for the year ended 28 February 2015.</li>
	<li>Cash allowance in lieu of pension for executive Directors other than Joris Brams equal to 25% of base salary (based on salary as at 1 March 2015).</li>
	<li>The Long Term Remuneration element is based on existing contractual entitlements - i.e. an ESOS award equal to 150% of salary and a LTIP (Part I) award equal to 100% of salary.</li>
	<li>The chart for Joris Brams excludes the fee that Joris Brams BVBA receives under its service contract for brand development services.</li>
</ul>
<p>The average exchange rate for FY2015 has been used for ease of comparison.</p>
<p>In illustrating the potential reward the following assumptions have been made:</p>

<h2>RECRUITMENT REMUNERATION POLICY</h2>
<p>When recruiting a new executive Director, the Committee will typically seek to use the policy detailed in the table above to determine the appropriate remuneration package to be offered. To facilitate the hiring of candidates of the appropriate calibre required to implement the Group’s strategy, the Committee retains the discretion to make payments or awards which are outside the Policy subject to the principles and limits set out below.</p>
<p>In determining appropriate remuneration, the Committee will take into consideration all relevant factors (including the quantum and nature of remuneration) to ensure the arrangements are in the best interests of the Group and its shareholders. This may, for example, include (but is not limited to) the following circumstances:</p>
<ul class="list">
	<li>an interim appointment is made to fill an executive Director role on a short-term basis;</li>
	<li>exceptional circumstances require that the Chairman or a non-executive Director takes on an executive function on a short-term basis;</li>
	<li>an executive Director is recruited at a time in the year when it would be inappropriate to provide a bonus or long-term incentive award for that year as there would not be sufficient time to assess performance. Subject to the limit on variable remuneration set out below, the quantum in respect of the months employed during the year may be transferred to the subsequent year so that reward is provided on a fair and appropriate basis;</li>
	<li>the Executive received benefits at his previous employer which the Committee considers it appropriate to offer.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Committee may also alter the performance measures, performance period and vesting period of the annual bonus or long-term incentive, if the Committee determines that the circumstances of the recruitment merit such alteration. The rationale will be clearly explained.</p>
<p>The Committee may make an award to compensate the prospective employee for remuneration arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer. In doing so the Committee will take account of relevant factors regarding the forfeited arrangements which may include the form of any forfeited awards (e.g. cash or shares), any performance conditions attached to those awards (and the likelihood of meeting those conditions) and the time over which they would have vested. These awards or payments are excluded from the maximum level of variable remuneration referred to below; however, the Committee’s intention is that the value awarded or paid would be no higher than the expected value of the forfeited arrangements.</p>
<p>Recruitment awards will normally be liable to forfeiture or ‘clawback’ on early departure (i.e. within the first 12 months of employment).</p>
<p>It would be the Committee’s policy that a significant portion of the remuneration package (including any introductory awards) would be variable and linked to stretching performance targets and continued employment. The maximum level of variable remuneration that may be granted to new Directors (excluding buy-out arrangements) is 5 times base salary.</p>
<p>For the avoidance of doubt, if it were necessary to make an introductory cash award which was not performance-based, such as a guaranteed bonus payment, the Committee would include such an award within the overall limit of 5 times base salary. Where a position is filled internally, any pre-appointment remuneration entitlements or outstanding variable pay elements shall be allowed to continue according to the original terms.</p>
<p>Fees payable to a newly-appointed Chairman or non-executive Director will be in line with the fee policy in place at the time of appointment.</p>

<h2>POLICY ON PAYMENT FOR LOSS OF OFFICE</h2>
<h3>Executive Directors</h3>
<h4>Service Contracts</h4>
<p>Each of the executive Directors is employed on a service contract. Details of the service contracts of the executive Directors in office during the year are as follows:</p>

		<div>12 months</div>
		<div>n/a</div>
	</div>
</div>			
<!---->
<p>As set out in last year’s annual report, changes were made during the year to the structure of Joris Brams’ service contract to reflect his greater focus on the United States following our acquisition of VHCC and services being provided by his service company in respect of Belgian brand development. His service contract was split into a USA contract with VHCC and an amended contract with Wm. Magner Limited, with the same aggregate base salary and other terms but with no cash allowance in lieu of pension provision. In addition, C&amp;C IP Sàrl (‘CCIP’) entered into a contract for services effective as of 1 April 2014 with Joris Brams BVBA (‘JBB’), (a company wholly owned by Joris Brams and family), under which JBB agreed to provide to CCIP brand development services in relation to Belgian products and CCIP agreed to pay monthly fees totalling €91,540 on an annual basis.</p>
<h4>Compensation on Termination</h4>
<p>The service contracts of the executive Directors do not contain any pre-determined compensation payments in the event of termination of office or employment other than payment in lieu of notice.</p>
<p>The principles on which the compensation for loss of office would be approached are summarised below:</p>
<!---->
<div class="table col_2 text">
	<div class="row heading heavy_line">
		<div class="h_3"></div>
		<div>Policy</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row light_line">
		<div class="h_3">Notice period</div>
		<div>None of the executive Directors has a service contract with a notice period in excess of one year. Service contracts for new directors will generally be limited to 12 months’ notice by the Company. The contract for services between CCIP and JBB (a company wholly owned by Joris Brams and family) is terminable by either party on 12 months’ notice.</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row light_line">
		<div class="h_3">Termination payment/payment in lieu of notice</div>
		<div>The Company has retained the right to make payment to the executive Director of 12 months’ fixed remuneration in lieu of the notice period. Discretionary benefits may also include, but are not limited to, outplacement and legal fees.</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row light_line">
		<div class="h_3">Annual bonus</div>
		<div>Payment of the annual bonus would be at the discretion of the Committee on an individual basis and would be dependent upon the circumstances of their departure and their contribution to the business during the bonus period in question. A departing Director may be eligible, depending on the circumstances and subject to performance, for payment of a bonus pro-rata to the period of employment during the year, to be payable at the usual time.</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row light_line">
		<div class="h_3">Share based payments</div>
		<div>
			<p>The vesting of share based awards is governed by the rules of the relevant incentive plan.</p>
			<p>Under the ESOS and LTIP (Part I), ESOS 2015 and LTIP 2015 ‘good leavers’ typically include leavers due to death, injury, ill-health, disability, redundancy, retirement with the consent of the Company or business disposal or any other reason as determined by the Committee.</p>
			<p>Under the ESOS and LTIP (Part I) the extent to which an award vests for a good leaver will be determined taking into account the extent to which any performance conditions have been satisfied in the period from the grant date to the date of vesting.</p>
			<p>Under the ESOS 2015 and LTIP 2015 the provisions for ‘good leavers’ provide that awards will vest at the normal vesting point and taking account of the performance over the period and subject to pro-rating for time. The Committee has the discretion to accelerate vesting to the date of cessation of employment and to waive pro-rating for time.</p>
			<p>For any deferred annual bonus, the deferred bonus share award would be released as soon as practicable following termination (unless the Committee determines otherwise).</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row light_line">
		<div class="h_3">Mitigation</div>
		<div>Executive Directors’ service contracts contain no contractual provision for reduction in payments for mitigation or for early payment, and accordingly any payment during the notice period will not be reduced by any amount earned in that period from alternative employment obtained as a result of being released from employment with the Group before the end of the contractual notice period.</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row light_line">
		<div class="h_3">Other payments</div>
		<div>
			<p>Payments may be made under the Company’s all employee share plans which are governed by the Irish Revenue Commissioners and HMRC tax-advantaged plan rules and which cover leaver provisions. There is no discretionary treatment of leavers under these plans.</p>
			<p>Where on recruitment a buy-out award had been made outside the ESOS 2015 or LTIP 2015, then the applicable leaver provisions would be specified at the time of the award.</p>
		</div>
	</div>
</div>		
<!---->
<p>The Committee reserves the right to make additional exit payments where such payments are made in good faith in discharge of an existing legal obligation (or by way of damages for breach of such an obligation) or by way of settlement or compromise of any claim arising in connection with the termination of a Director’s office or employment. In doing so, the Committee will recognise and balance the interests of shareholders and the departing executive Director, as well as the interests of the remaining Directors. Where the Committee retains discretion it will be used to provide flexibility in certain situations, taking into account the particular circumstances of the Director’s departure and performance.</p>
<!---->
<h3>Non-executive Directors</h3>
<h4>Letters of appointment</h4>
<p>Each of the non-executive Directors in office during the financial year was appointed by way of a letter of appointment. Each appointment was for an initial term of three years, renewable by agreement (but now subject to annual re-election by the members in General Meeting). The letters of appointment are dated as follows:</p>

<p class="large">Implementation of the Remuneration Policy for the Year Ending 28 February 2016</p>
<p>Information on how the Company intends to implement the policy for the financial year ending 28 February 2016 is set out below.</p>
<!---->			
<h2>EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS</h2>
<h3>Structure</h3>
<p>The fundamental structure of the remuneration of Stephen Glancey, Kenny Neison and Joris Brams remains unchanged from the previous year. Specifically there are no changes to their salary, the maximum rate of the annual bonus, the ESOS and LTIP (Part I) opportunity or the rate of the cash allowance in lieu of pension or benefits in kind.</p>
<!---->
<h3>Base salaries</h3>
<p>The Company’s approach on base salary continues to be to provide a fixed remuneration component which reflects the experience and capabilities of the individual in the role, the demonstrated performance of the individual in the role, and which is competitive in the markets in which the Company operates.</p>
<p>Under their service contracts the base salaries of Stephen Glancey and Kenny Neison are expressed and payable in pounds sterling. The base salary of Joris Brams is expressed and payable in euro.</p>
<p>The salary levels of executive Directors are normally reviewed together with those of senior management annually in January. The salary levels were reviewed in respect of FY2016 and no change is being made to the base salaries of Stephen Glancey and Kenny Neison for the year ending 28 February 2016. Their base salaries have remained unchanged since 2008 other than by reason of promotion. No change is proposed to the base salary of Joris Brams.</p>
<p>The base salaries are as follows:</p>

<h3>Benefits</h3>
<p>The executive Directors receive a cash allowance of 7.5% of base salary in lieu of benefits such as company car. The Group provides death-in-service cover of four times annual base salary and permanent health insurance (or reimbursement of premiums paid into a personal policy). Directors may also benefit from medical insurance under a Group policy (or the Group will reimburse premiums).</p>
<p>Details of the deferred payments due by Stephen Glancey and Kenny Neison under the JSOP, as described further down, and which give rise to a taxable benefit-in-kind, are unchanged.</p>
<!---->
<h3>Annual bonus</h3>
<p>The Committee has reviewed the performance measures and targets for the annual bonus to ensure that they remain appropriately stretching in the current environment and continue to be aligned with the business strategy.</p>
<p>For FY2016, the Committee has approved a bonus scheme for executive Directors by reference to Group adjusted operating profit, under which executive Directors will be entitled to a bonus of 30% of salary for on target performance, and a further bonus on a tapering basis in respect of performance above this level up to a maximum of 80% of base salary.</p>
<p>The Company is not disclosing the actual Group bonus profit target prospectively as, in the opinion of the Board, this target is commercially sensitive. The Board believes that disclosure of this commercially sensitive information could adversely impact the Company’s competitive position by providing competitors with insight into the Company’s business plans and expectations. However, the Company will disclose how the bonus pay out delivered relates to performance against target on a retrospective basis.</p>
<p>In FY2015, the maximum bonus opportunity for the executive Directors was 80% of salary. Target bonus was 30% of salary (37.5% of the maximum opportunity). In FY2015, 100% of the bonus was based on the financial performance of the Group. Further details of how bonuses are earned are provided in the table below.</p>

<h3>Long Term Incentives</h3>
<p>The service contracts of the executive Directors in office at the date of this report entitle them to an annual grant under the ESOS with a face value equal to 150% of base salary and an annual award under the LTIP (Part I) with a face value equal to 100% of base salary.</p>
<p>With respect to awards for FY2016, options/awards will be granted under the existing ESOS and the LTIP (Part I). Subject to shareholder approval at the 2015 AGM, a new Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP 2015”) and a new Executive Share Option Scheme (“ESOS 2015”) will be adopted. Awards will not be granted under the new arrangements until FY2017.</p>
<!---->
<h3>ESOS (existing)</h3>
<p>The executive Directors will be granted options with a face value of 150% of base salary with an exercise price equal to the share price at the date of grant. The cliff vesting schedule for the ESOS will be replaced with a more balanced EPS performance schedule for options granted in FY2016 as follows: if adjusted EPS growth is 3% per annum over the performance period then 50% of the ESOS award vests and if adjusted EPS growth is 6% per annum or more over the performance period the ESOS award vests in full. There will be straight line vesting between the points and no reward for below threshold performance. This broadly maintains the level of stretch required for full vesting and recognises that CPI is a less relevant reference point given the international reach of the business. The threshold level of vesting has been set at 50% of the award to reflect the fact that, in contrast to LTIP awards, ESOS awards only deliver value above the share price at the date of grant and only if the threshold EPS target has been achieved.</p>
<!---->	
<h3>LTIP (Part I) (existing)</h3>
<p>The executive Directors will be granted awards to acquire shares with a face value of 100% of base salary. Awards in FY2016 will have the same performance conditions attaching as in FY2015. 75% of the award is based on earnings per share and 25% of the award is based on total shareholder return against the ISEQ as detailed further down.</p>
<!---->			
<h3>Pensions</h3>
<p>No executive Director accrues any benefits under a defined benefit pension scheme. Under their service contracts executive Directors other than Joris Brams will receive a cash payment of 25% of base salary, in order to provide their own pension benefits, inclusive in Kenny Neison’s case of a fixed sterling payment into a personal pension plan.</p>
<!---->			
<h3>Legacy Payments</h3>
<p>See <a href="financial-statements/notes.html">note 4</a> (Share-based Payments) to the financial statements regarding payments that may fall due under or in respect of the Joint Share Ownership Plan.</p>
<!---->
<h2>NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS</h2>
<p>The fees paid to non-executive Directors are set at a level to attract individuals with the necessary experience and ability to make a significant contribution to the Group. The annual fees, which were last reviewed by the Board in May 2014 and are unchanged from FY2015, are as follows:</p>

<h3>Column (b) Benefits</h3>
<p>(1) The executive Directors received a cash allowance of 7.5% of base salary. The Group provided death-in-service cover of four times annual base salary and permanent health insurance (or reimbursement of premiums paid into a personal policy). Stephen Glancey and Kenny Neison also availed of medical insurance under a Group policy.</p>
<p>(2) When an award is granted to an executive under the Joint Share Ownership Plan, its value is assessed for tax purposes with the resulting value being deemed to fall due for payment on the date of grant. Under the terms of the Plan, the executive paid the Entry Price at the date of grant and, if the tax value of the award (i.e. the initial unrestricted market value) exceeds the Entry Price, the executive must pay a further amount, equating to the amount of such excess, before a sale of the awarded Interests. The deferral of the payment of the further amount is considered to be an interest-free loan by the Company to the executive and a taxable benefit-in-kind arises, charged at Revenue stipulated rates (Ireland 13.5%; UK 4.0% for the period up to and including 5 April 2014 and 3.25% for the period from 6 April 2014). The resulting loans by the Company to the executive Directors are required to be disclosed under the Companies Act 1990. The balances of the loans outstanding to the executive Directors as at 28 February 2015 and 28 February 2014 are as follows:</p>

<p>When the further amount is paid, the Company compensates the executive for the obligation to pay this further amount by paying him an equivalent amount, which is, however, subject to income tax and social security in the hands of the executive.</p>
<p>Further details of the Joint Share Ownership Plan are given in note 4 (Share-based Payments) to the financial statements. No further awards can be made. All extant awards are fully vested.</p>

<h3>Column (c) Annual Bonus</h3>
<p>(1) The amounts shown are the total bonus earned under the annual bonus scheme in respect of the financial year.</p>
<p>(2) For the year ended 28 February 2015, the annual bonus for executive Directors was based on performance against a Group adjusted operating profit target. The maximum bonus opportunity was 80% of salary. No bonus was paid to the executive Directors for the year ended 28 February 2015.</p>
<!---->
<h3>Column (d) Long term incentives</h3>
<p>(1) The amounts shown in respect of long term incentives are the values of awards where final vesting is determined as a result of the achievement of performance measures or targets relating to the financial year and is not subject to achievement of further measures or targets in future financial years.</p>
<p>(2) For the year ended 28 February 2015, no amounts will vest in respect of the LTIP (Part I) and ESOS awards granted in May 2012 and which would otherwise vest in May 2015. The performance conditions for these awards are detailed below and the Remuneration Committee has determined that threshold performance has not been met under any of the measures and accordingly the awards have lapsed.</p>
<h4>ESOS</h4>
<p>In respect of options granted in May 2012, if the growth in EPS (before exceptional or extraordinary items and including any other adjustments authorised by the Remuneration Committee) in the three years to 28 February 2015 is at least 5% per annum compound plus Irish CPI then the awards vest in full. If this growth is not achieved then all options lapse.</p>
