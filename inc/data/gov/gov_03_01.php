	<p>Dear Shareholder</p>
	<p>We, as a Board, and a Company, take corporate governance very seriously, and consider that good conduct is the basis of good performance. The Board sets the tone for the rest of the Company. We believe that effective governance is the foundation of a successful and sustainable organisation and should be based upon an appropriate level of oversight, clear communication and a commitment to transparency. Governance is the framework within which we focus on the health and growth of the business.</p>
	<p>In this report we provide an overview of our corporate governance practices, describing how the main principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code and Irish Annex are applied throughout the year. Information is given about the Board, its members and committees, and their work. An overview of the Company’s internal controls is also given.</p>
	<p>We have continued our focus on Board succession issues and in that context, at the conclusion of this year’s Annual General Meeting, John Hogan will step down as Chairman of the Audit Committee and be succeeded by Emer Finnan. John will remain as a Director until the end of 2015 to ensure a smooth transition. In considering Board appointments, we continue to have regard to the degree of diversity of experience and background of the Board.</p>
	<p>We are complying this year with the new edition of the UK Corporate Governance Code published by the Financial Reporting Council in September 2014 (the ‘UK Code’) and the Irish Corporate Governance Annex (the ‘Irish Annex’).</p>

			<h2>COMPLIANCE STATEMENT</h2>
			<p>C&amp;C Group plc is incorporated and resident in Ireland and is subject to Irish company law. It has a primary listing on the Irish Stock Exchange (‘ISE’) and a listing in the Premium Listing segment of the Official List of the United Kingdom Listing Authority (‘UKLA’) and its shares are quoted on the ISE and the London Stock Exchange (‘LSE’). C&amp;C Group plc also has a Level 1 American Depository Receipt (ADR) programme.</p>
			<p>The Directors are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and to reviewing governance best-practice on a continuing basis to ensure that we adapt and evolve in what is an environment of constant change. The Listing Rules of the ISE require every company listed on the Main Securities Market of the ISE to state in its annual report how the principles of the UK Code have been applied and whether the company has complied with all relevant provisions of the UK Code and the Irish Annex, which implements additional requirements for companies with a primary equity listing on the Main Securities Market of the ISE.</p>
			<p>The Group has complied with the provisions of the UK Code and Irish Annex throughout the period under review. This Corporate Governance statement describes the Group’s policy on corporate governance during the financial year ended 28 February 2015.</p>
<!---->
			<h2>BOARD OF DIRECTORS</h2>
			<h3>Role</h3>
			<p>The Board is responsible for the oversight, leadership and control of the Group and its long-term success. There is a formal schedule of matters reserved to the Board for decision. This includes approval of Group strategic plans, annual budgets, financial statements, significant contracts and capital expenditure items, major acquisitions and disposals, changes to capital structure, circulars, Board appointments, and the review of the Group’s corporate governance arrangements and system of internal control, and approval of policies including corporate responsibility and health and safety. The Board is also responsible for instilling the appropriate culture, values and behaviour throughout the Group. The Directors acknowledge that they are responsible for the proper stewardship of the Group’s affairs, both on an individual and collective basis. The matters and agenda reserved for Board consideration reflect this responsibility.</p>
			<p>The roles of the Chairman and the Group Chief Executive Officer are separate with a clear division of responsibility between them, which is set out in writing and which has been approved by the Board. The Chairman has responsibility for the management of the Board, the performance of Directors and their induction, development and performance evaluation, ensuring there are effective relations with shareholders and for the AGM. The Chief Executive is responsible, within the authority limits delegated by the Board, for business strategy and management, investment and financing, risk management and controls, timely reporting, making recommendations on remuneration policy and on the appointment of executive directors, setting Group HR policies and leading the communications programme with shareholders.</p>
			<p>The Board delegates responsibility for the management of the Group through the Group Chief Executive Officer to executive management. The Board also delegates some of its responsibilities to Board Committees, details of which are set out below. The responsibilities of the Chairman are covered in detail below.</p>
			<p>The Chief Executive has full day-to-day operational and profit responsibility for the Group and is accountable to the Board for all authority delegated to executive management. His overall brief is to execute agreed strategy, to co-ordinate and maintain the continued profitability of the Group and to oversee senior management responsible for the day-to-day running of the business.</p>
			<p>Non-executive Directors are expected to constructively challenge management proposals and to examine and review management performance in meeting agreed objectives and targets. In addition, they are expected to draw on their own specific experience and knowledge in respect of any challenges facing the Group and in relation to the development of proposals on strategy.</p>
			<p>Individual Directors may seek independent professional advice at the Company’s expense where they judge it necessary to discharge their responsibilities as Directors.</p>
			<p>The Group has a policy in place which indemnifies the Directors in respect of certain legal actions taken against them.</p>
			<h3>Board Composition, Membership and Renewal</h3>
			<p>The Board considers that, between them, the Directors bring a range of skills, knowledge and experience so as to provide leadership, control and oversight of the Group and discharge their responsibility to all shareholders. The biographical details of the current Directors are set out on <a href="corporate-governance/board-directors.html">here</a>. The Company’s Articles of Association require that the number of Directors shall be not less than two and not more than 14. The Board regards the number of non-executive Directors currently appointed to the Board as sufficient to ensure satisfactory oversight of the Group’s management and to enable its Committees to operate without undue reliance on individual non-executive Directors. The Board has an ongoing programme for Board refreshment and renewal, recognising the need for independence and diversity, including gender diversity, on the Board. </p>
			<p>As at 28 February 2015, the Board was comprised of ten Directors, of whom three were executive and seven were non-executive Directors (including the Chairman).  Consistent with our commitment to Board refreshment and development, at the conclusion of this year’s Annual General Meeting, John Hogan will step down as Chairman of the Audit Committee and be succeeded by Emer Finnan. John will remain as a Director until the end of 2015 to ensure a smooth transition.  Emer is a qualified chartered accountant and will bring considerable financial expertise to the role of Audit Committee Chairman.</p>
			<h3>Board Independence</h3>
			<p>In line with the UK Code, it is Board policy that at least half the Board, excluding the Chairman, shall consist of independent non-executive Directors. The Board has reviewed the composition of the Board and has determined that of the Directors as at 28 February 2015, John Hogan, Richard Holroyd, Breege O’Donoghue, Stewart Gilliland, Anthony Smurfit and Emer Finnan were independent.</p>
			<p>The independence of Board members is considered annually. In determining the independence of non-executive Directors, the Board considered the principles relating to independence contained in the UK Code and the guidance provided by a number of shareholder voting agencies. Those principles and guidance address a number of factors that might appear to affect the independence of Directors, including former service as an executive of the Group, extended service to the Board and cross-directorships. However, they also make clear that a Director may be considered independent notwithstanding the presence of one or more of these factors. This reflects the Board’s view that independence is determined by a Director’s character and judgement. The Board considers that each of the non-executive Directors brings independent judgement to bear. In the case of Richard Holroyd, Breege O’Donoghue and John Hogan, the Board has considered their length of service but is satisfied that their independence is not compromised. As part of this assessment, the Board considers that, while each of them has served on the Board of the Company since 2004, none of them has served for more than nine years concurrently with the same executive Directors. As set out in the table below, each has served on the Board concurrently with the Group’s Chief Executive, the longest serving executive Director, for 6.5 years. The Board recognises the principles of the Code and guidelines on tenure but is satisfied that the objectivity, judgements and independence of each of the Directors is not compromised by tenure on the Board. The Board also has an ongoing programme of Board refreshment and renewal and has appointed three new Directors in the past three years.</p>
			<p>The Board has also noted that Anthony Smurfit is a shareholder and director of Smurfit Kappa Group plc, which provides packaging materials to the Group on normal commercial terms, and is satisfied that it is not a material transaction for either company and that his independence is not compromised. In the case of Sir Brian Stewart, the Board was satisfied that he was independent on his appointment as referred to below.</p>

<h3>Chairman</h3>
<p>Sir Brian Stewart has been Chairman of the Group since August 2010. The Chairman is responsible for the efficient and effective working of the Board. He is responsible for ensuring that the Board considers the key strategic issues facing the Group and that the Directors receive accurate, timely, relevant and clear information. He also ensures that there is effective communication with shareholders and that the Board is apprised of the views of the Group’s shareholders. As part of this process, the Chairman recently completed a series of meetings, focused solely on corporate governance, with a number of the Group’s largest institutional shareholders.</p>
<p>While the Board has determined that Sir Brian Stewart was independent on appointment to the Board, it recognises that previous working relationships with the Group’s senior executives is a consideration in determining independence as set out by the UK Code and by some shareholder voting agencies. Consequently, while the Board was satisfied as to Sir Brian’s independence, he stepped down from his position as a member of the Remuneration Committee on his appointment as Chairman. During the period under review there was no change in the other significant commitments of the Chairman.</p>
<!---->
<h3>Senior Independent Director</h3>
<p>Richard Holroyd was appointed Senior Independent Director in July 2007. He is available to shareholders who have concerns for which contact through the normal channels of Chairman, Group Chief Executive Officer or Group Chief Financial Officer has failed to resolve or for which such contact is inappropriate. He is also available to meet major shareholders on request.</p>
<!---->
<h3>Audit Committee Financial Expert</h3>
<p>The Audit Committee has determined that John Hogan, who also chairs the Committee, is the Audit Committee financial expert. He is a qualified chartered accountant and was the managing partner of Ernst &amp; Young in Ireland between 1994 and 2000. He was also a member of the Ernst &amp; Young global board. Emer Finnan, who will assume the role of Audit Committee Chair following the 2015 AGM, is a qualified chartered accountant and has recent and relevant financial expertise.</p>
<!---->
<h3>Company Secretary</h3>
<p>David Johnston is the Company Secretary. All Directors have access to the Company Secretary, who is responsible to the Board for ensuring that Board procedures are complied with. The appointment and removal of the Company Secretary is a matter for the Board.</p>
<h3>Appointment, Retirement and Re-election</h3>
<p>The non-executive Directors are engaged under the terms of letters of appointment, details of which are set out in the Report of the Remuneration Committee on Directors’ Remuneration. Copies of the letters of appointment are available on request from the Company Secretary.</p>
<p>The Company’s Articles of Association require that at least one-third of the Directors subject to rotation shall retire by rotation at the Annual General Meeting in every year. Directors appointed by the Board must also submit themselves for election at the first annual general meeting following their appointment. However, in accordance with the recommendations of the UK Code, the Directors have resolved that they will all retire and submit themselves for re-election by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting this year.</p>
<!---->
<h3>Induction and Development</h3>
<p>A comprehensive tailored induction programme is arranged for each new Director. The aim of the programme is to provide the Director with a detailed insight into the Group. The programme involves meeting with the Chairman, Group Chief Executive Officer, Group Chief Financial Officer, Company Secretary and key senior executives. It covers areas such as strategy and development, organisation structure, succession planning, financing, corporate responsibility and compliance, investor relations and risk management. The Board receives regular updates from its external legal and other advisers in relation to regulatory and accounting developments. Throughout the year, Directors meet with key executives and meet with local management teams, and a site visit for all Board Directors to one of the Group’s production facilities is usually scheduled annually.</p>
<p>Newly-appointed members of the Audit Committee will meet with the key members of the external audit, internal audit and finance teams. New members of the Remuneration Committee will meet with the Committee’s remuneration consultants in the year of their appointment to the Committee.</p>
<h3>External non-executive directorships</h3>
<p>The Board recognises that there can be benefit if executive Directors accept a non-executive directorship with other companies to broaden their skills, knowledge and experience. Joris Brams is currently a non-executive director at Democo NV, a Belgian construction company.</p>
<p>Apart from him, currently none of the executive Directors has such an appointment. The Remuneration Committee determines whether Directors should be permitted to retain any fees paid in respect of such appointments. The Remuneration Committee has determined that Joris Brams is permitted to retain fees from his appointment.</p>
<!---->
<h3>Meetings</h3>
<p>During the period under review there were ten scheduled meetings of the Board and a further two short notice meetings. Details of Directors’ attendance at these meetings are set out in the table on page 60. Several ad hoc meetings without notice were held during the year for share allotment and other administrative matters in accordance with the Board’s procedures. In addition, a meeting of members of the Board was held without the executive Directors present to provide an opportunity for non-executive Directors and the Chairman to assess their performance, and a further meeting of the non-executive Directors led by the Senior Independent Director was held without the Chairman being present to assess the Chairman’s performance. The Board usually makes at least one visit a year to one of the operating subsidiaries, and this year the Board visited the Wellpark Brewery, Glasgow.</p>
<p>The Chairman sets the agenda for each meeting in consultation with the Group Chief Executive Officer and the Company Secretary. The agenda and Board papers, which provide the Directors with relevant information to enable them to fully consider the agenda items in advance, are circulated prior to each meeting. Directors are encouraged to participate in debate and constructive challenge. While Directors are expected to attend all scheduled meetings, in the event a Director is unable to attend a meeting, his or her view on all agenda items is sought and conveyed to the Chairman in advance of the meeting. In addition, following the meeting, matters discussed and decisions made at the meeting are conveyed to the Director.</p>
<!---->
<h3>Performance evaluation</h3>
<p>The Board recognises the importance of a formal and rigorous evaluation of the performance of the Board and its Committees. The Chairman conducts an annual review of corporate governance and the operation and performance of the Board and its Committees. In the year under review the Chairman has reviewed the performance of individual Directors and, within the remit of the Nomination Committee, succession planning, identifying in this process the experience and qualities required by the Group for the future implementation of its strategy.</p>
<p>The Chairman conducts one to one discussions each year with each Director to assess his or her individual performance. Performance is assessed against a number of criteria, including his or her contribution to Board and Committee meetings; time commitments; contribution to strategic developments; and relationships with other Directors and management.</p>
<p>The Senior Independent Director and the other non-executive Directors review the Chairman’s performance and the Board’s performance each year, the results being reported back to the Chairman with any recommendations.</p>
<p>In addition to the internal reviews and evaluations described above, during the year, the Board also engaged an external advisor to complete an independent evaluation of the performance and effectiveness of the Board and each of the Committees. This evaluation is in line with the recommendations of the UK Code which requires an external Board evaluation to be conducted at least once every three years. The company engaged to perform the evaluation has no business connection or relationship with the Group, its directors or senior management.</p>
<!---->
<h3>Remuneration</h3>
<p>Details of remuneration paid to Directors (executive and non-executive) are set out in the <a href="corporate-governance/report-director-remuneration.html">Report of the Remuneration Committee on Directors’ Remuneration</a>.</p>
<p>Non-executive Directors are remunerated by way of a Director’s fee. Additional fees are also payable to the Chairman of the Audit Committee, Chairman of the Remuneration Committee and to the Senior Independent Director. Non-executive Directors’ fees and additional fees payable to Committee Chairmen and the Senior Independent Director have not been increased since 2008.</p>
<p>It is Board policy that non-executive Director remuneration does not comprise any performance-related element and, therefore, non-executive Directors are not eligible to participate in the Group’s bonus schemes, option plans or share award schemes. Non-executive Directors’ fees are not pensionable and non-executive Directors are not eligible to join any Group pension plans. Executive Directors’ remuneration is inclusive of any Director’s fee.</p>
<p>The current limit under the Articles on Directors’ ordinary remuneration (i.e. directors’ fees, not including executive remuneration) is €1,000,000, pursuant to a resolution passed at the 2013 Annual General Meeting.</p>
<p>The report of the Remuneration Committee and the policy on Directors’ Remuneration will be presented to shareholders for the purposes of a non-binding advisory vote at the Annual General Meeting on 2 July 2015.  Our policy on Directors’ remuneration has been updated to reflect the provisions of the new share incentive plans that we are putting to shareholders this year and we will therefore again be presenting this policy to shareholders for an advisory vote at the Annual General Meeting. While there is no legal obligation for the Group to put such resolutions to a vote of shareholders at the Annual General Meeting, the Board recognises that such resolutions are now considered good governance practice.</p>
<!---->
<h3>Share ownership and dealing</h3>
<p>The Company has introduced share ownership guidelines for the executive Directors to ensure the interests of executive Directors are aligned with those of shareholders. In summary, the guidelines are that the current market value of shares in the Company held by the relevant Director should be at least two times salary for the Chief Executive and one times salary for other executive Directors. If share ownership guidelines are not met, then individuals must retain up to 50% of vested share awards (net of tax). Further information including details of Directors’ shareholdings is set out <a href="corporate-governance/report-director-remuneration.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>The Group has a policy on dealing in shares that applies to all Directors and senior management. This policy adopts the terms of the Model Code as set out in the Listing Rules published by the UK Listing Authority and the Irish Stock Exchange. Under this policy, Directors are required to obtain clearance from the Chairman (or in the case of the Chairman himself, from the Senior Independent Director) before dealing. Directors and senior management are prohibited from dealing in the Company’s shares during close periods and at any other time when the individual is in possession of Inside Information (as defined by the Market Abuse (Directive 2003/6/EC) Regulations 2005).</p>
<!---->
<h2>COMMITTEES</h2>
<p>The Board has established three permanent committees to assist in the execution of its responsibilities. These are the Audit Committee, the Nomination Committee and the Remuneration Committee. The current membership of each committee is set out <a href="corporate-governance/board-directors.html">here</a>. Attendance at meetings held is set out further down.</p>
<p>Each of the permanent Board Committees has terms of reference under which authority is delegated to them by the Board. These terms of reference are available on the Company’s website www.candcgroupplc.com. Minutes of all Committee meetings are circulated to the entire Board.</p>
<p>The Chairman of each committee attends the Annual General Meeting and is available to answer questions from shareholders.</p>
<p>The Board has also established a Disclosure Committee comprising the Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and the Company Secretary. The Head of Investor Relations may also participate where required. The main responsibilities of the Disclosure Committee include:</p>
<ul class="list">
	<li>determining whether information constitutes inside information;</li>

	<li>reviewing and approving material announcements;</li>
	<li>monitoring leaks, rumours, speculation and market expectations, and taking appropriate action;</li>

</ul>
<p>Ad hoc committees are formed from time to time to deal with other specific matters.</p>

<p>The activities undertaken by the Committee in fulfilling its key responsibilities in respect of the year ended 28 February 2015 are set out below.</p>
<!---->
<h3>Financial Statements</h3>
<p>In respect of the year ended 28 February 2015 the Audit Committee reviewed:</p>
<ul class="list">			
	<li>the Interim Management Statements issued in July 2014 and January 2015;</li>
	<li>the Financial Report for the six months ended 31 August 2014;</li>
	<li>the preliminary results announcement and the Annual Report and financial statements for the year ended 28 February 2015.</li>
</ul>
<p>In particular the Committee addressed the going concern status of the Company and the matters referred to in the Financial Review contained in the 2015 Annual Report. It reviewed the post-audit report from the external auditor identifying any accounting or judgemental issues requiring its attention.</p>
<p>In carrying out these reviews, the Committee considered:</p>
<ul class="list">
	<li>the consistency of, and any changes to, accounting policies both on a year on year basis and across the Group;</li>
	<li>whether the Group had applied appropriate accounting policies and practices and made appropriate estimates and judgements, taking into account the views of the external auditor;</li>
	<li>the methods used to account for significant or unusual transactions where different approaches are possible;</li>
	<li>whether the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, business model and strategy;</li>
	<li>the clarity and completeness of disclosures and compliance with relevant financial reporting standards and corporate governance and regulatory requirements; and</li>
	<li>the significant areas in which judgement had been applied in preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the accounting policies.</li>
</ul>
<p>The significant issues considered by the Committee in relation to the accounts for the year to 28 February 2015 and how these were addressed are outlined below. Each of these areas received particular focus from the external auditor, who provided detailed analysis and assessment of the matter in their report to the Committee.</p>
<!---->
<h3>Goodwill &amp; intangible assets impairment testing</h3>
<p>The Committee considered the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets as at the year end date to assess whether or not it exceeded the expected recoverable amounts for these assets. In particular the Committee reviewed the value-in-use financial models used to support the valuation and the key assumptions and judgements used by management underlying these models. The key assumptions used in the financial models and consequently the key focus areas for the Committee relate to future volume, net revenue and operating profit growth and the achievability of same, the growth rate in perpetuity and the discount rate applied to the resulting cash flows.</p>
<p>The Committee considered the outcome of the financial models and in all instances concluded that the outcome was appropriate, including the recognition of, and magnitude of, an impairment charge with respect to the US business. In all other segments the Committee considered the level of headroom and the sensitivity analysis applied to the key assumptions and concluded that the carrying values were appropriate.</p>
<!---->
<h3>Valuation of property, plant &amp; equipment</h3>
<p>The Group values its land and buildings and plant machinery at market value/depreciated replacement cost (DRC) and consequently carries out an annual valuation. The Group engages external valuers to value the Group’s property, plant &amp; machinery every three years or as at the date of acquisition for assets acquired as part of a business acquisition. The Group completed an external valuation in the current financial year for its Irish assets (with the exception of Gleesons’ which were valued on acquisition in the prior year), the Group’s UK assets and the Group’s US assets (with the exception of the recently built cidery).  An internal assessment was completed for assets which were outside the scope of the external valuation.</p>
<p>In assessing the reasonableness of the external and internal valuations, the Committee reviewed the key assumptions and judgements underlying the valuations, in particular considering the impact of gross replacement cost price movements, depreciation rates reflecting age of asset and physical and functional obsolescence and forecast utilisation levels across the Group’s production sites included in the valuation, and is satisfied that carrying value is appropriate.</p>

<h3>Internal control and risk management systems</h3>
<p>The Group’s system of internal control and risk management is described below.</p>
<p>The terms of reference of the Audit Committee require it to conduct an annual assessment of internal financial controls and financial risk management systems. The risks facing the Group are reviewed regularly by the Audit Committee with executive management. Specific annual reviews of the risks and fundamental controls of each business unit are undertaken. The results and recommendations are reported to and analysed by the Audit Committee and a programme for action agreed with the business units. In carrying out these responsibilities during the year, the Committee reviewed reports issued by both the internal audit function and the external auditor and held regular discussions with the Head of Internal Audit and representatives of the external auditor. The Committee also reviewed the outcome of an assessment of the Group’s internal financial controls which had been coordinated by the internal audit function.</p>
<!---->
<h3>Internal Audit</h3>
<p>The Committee is responsible for monitoring and reviewing the operation and effectiveness of the internal audit function including its focus, plans, activities and resources.</p>
<p>The Group’s internal audit function reports to the Audit Committee and the Audit Committee has approved its terms of reference. The Group’s internal auditor is engaged on a programme of work, which includes, inter alia, maintaining the Group’s risk register and examining the fundamental controls of the Group.</p>
<p>During the year, the Committee reviewed and approved the internal audit plan for the year and considered the adequacy of staffing levels and expertise within the function. There was a change in personnel during the year and a short period during the year where no internal auditor was in place but this was resolved before year end and had no material impact on the internal audit function during the year.</p>
<p>The Committee received regular reports from the Head of Internal Audit summarising findings of the team’s work and the responses from management to deal with the findings. The Committee monitors progress on the implementation of the action plans on significant findings to ensure these are completed satisfactorily.</p>
<!---->
<h3>External Auditor</h3>
<p>The Committee manages the relationship with the Group’s external auditors on behalf of the Board. The Committee carries out an annual assessment of the external auditor including a review of the external auditor’s internal policies and procedures for maintaining independence and objectivity and consideration of their approach to audit quality. The external auditor is professionally required to rotate the audit partner responsible for the Group audit every five years. The current audit partner has been in place since 2012.</p>
<h4>External audit process</h4>
<p>The Committee also reviewed and approved the external audit plan as presented by the external auditor and assessed the qualifications and expertise of their resources. The Committee also reviewed the external auditor’s engagement letter and recommended the level of remuneration of the external auditor to the Board having reviewed the scope and nature of the work to be performed. The Committee assessed the effectiveness of the external audit process by monitoring performance against the agreed audit plan and noting the results of post-audit interviews with management and the Audit Committee Chairman.</p>
<h4>Length of service of auditors</h4>
<p>KPMG have been the external auditor of the Company since the Company’s formation and flotation in 2004. The UK Code recommends that listed companies of the size of the Group should put the external audit contract out to tender at least every ten years. The external audit contract was put out to tender in FY2014. The Committee concluded that KPMG continued to provide an effective audit service and there were no compelling reasons for change that would outweigh the advantages of continuity and consequently recommended the re-appointment of KPMG.  The recommendation was accepted by the Board.</p>
<h4>Hiring of former employees of auditor</h4>
<p>In order to ensure the independence and objectivity of the external auditor, the prior approval of the Audit Committee is required before any individual is appointed to a senior managerial position in the Group, if such individual has within three years prior to such proposed appointment been employed by the external auditor.</p>
<h4>Non-Audit Services by auditor</h4>
<p>The Group has a policy in place governing the provision of non-audit services by the external auditor in order to ensure that the external auditor’s objectivity and independence is safeguarded.</p>
<p>Under this policy the auditor is prohibited from providing non-audit services if the auditor:</p>
<ul class="list">
	<li>may, as a result, be required to audit its own firm’s work;</li>
	<li>would participate in activities that would normally be undertaken by management;</li>
	<li>would be remunerated through a “success fee” structure or have some other mutual financial interest with the Group;</li>
	<li>would be acting in an advocacy role for the Group.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other than above, the Company does not impose an automatic ban on the external auditor providing non-audit services. However, the external auditor is only permitted to provide non-audit services that are not, or are not perceived to be, in conflict with auditor independence and objectivity, if it has the skill, competence and integrity to carry out the work and it is considered by the Audit Committee to be the most appropriate to undertake such work in the best interests of the Group. The engagement of the external auditor to provide non-audit services must be approved in advance by the Audit Committee or entered into pursuant to pre-approved policies and procedures established by the Audit Committee and approved by the Board.</p>
<p>The nature, extent and scope of non-audit services provided to the Group by the external auditor and the economic importance of the Group to the external auditor are also monitored to ensure that the external auditor’s independence and objectivity is not impaired. The Audit Committee has adopted a policy that, except in exceptional circumstances with the prior approval of the Audit Committee, non-audit fees paid to the Group’s Auditor should not exceed 100% of audit fees in any one financial year.</p>
<p>During the year, KPMG provided non-audit advisory services, being advice on taxation and other related matters. In approving KPMG to provide these services the Committee was of the opinion that KPMG’s knowledge of the Group was an important factor. The Committee was also satisﬁed that the fees paid to KPMG for non-audit work did not compromise their independence or integrity. Details of the amounts paid to KPMG during the year for audit and other services are set out in <a href="financial-statements/notes.html">note 2</a> to the financial statements.</p>
<!---->
<h3>Whistle-blowing procedures</h3>
<p>In line with best practice, the Group supports an independent and confidential whistle-blowing service which allows UK and ROI employees to raise any concerns about business practice in a confidential manner.  During the year, a similar service was rolled out to VHCC employees in the US.</p>

<p>The Committee and Board further realise that diversity extends beyond the Board and in this regard seeks to ensure that all recruitment decisions are fair and non-discriminatory.</p>
<!---->
<h3>Independent consultants</h3>
<p>The Nomination Committee is empowered to use the services of independent consultants to facilitate the search for suitable candidates for appointment as non-executive Directors.</p>
<p>During the year, the Committee appointed Spencer Stuart, an independent executive search firm, to assist in a search process for non-executive director candidates with relevant experience and skills. Spencer Stuart has no other connection with the Group.</p>
<!---->

<h2>COMMUNICATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS</h2>
<p>The Group attaches considerable importance to shareholder communications and has an established investor relations programme.</p>
<p>There is regular dialogue with institutional investors with presentations given to investors at the time of the release of the Group’s first half and full year financial results and when other significant announcements are made. Interim Management Statements were issued in July 2014 and January 2015. The Board is briefed regularly on the views and concerns of institutional shareholders. The Chairman has also recently completed a series of meetings, focused solely on corporate governance, with a number of the Group’s largest institutional shareholders.</p>
<p>The Group’s website, <a href="http://www.candcgroupplc.com/investors/financial-reports" target="_blank">www.candcgroupplc.com</a>, provides the full text of the Annual Report and financial statements, the Interim Report and other releases. News releases are also made available immediately after release to the Stock Exchange. Presentations given to investors and at conferences are also made available on the Company’s website.</p>
<!---->
<h3>General Meetings</h3>
<p>The Company operates under the Companies Acts 1963 to 2013. These Acts provide for two types of shareholder meetings: the Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’) with all other meetings being called extraordinary general meetings (‘EGM’).</p>
<p>The Company must hold a general meeting in each year as its AGM in addition to any other general meetings held in that year. Not more than 15 months may elapse between the date of one AGM and the next. An AGM was held on 3 July 2014, and this year’s AGM will be held on 2 July 2015. The Directors may at any time call an EGM. EGMs may also be convened on the requisition of members holding not less than five per cent of the voting share capital of the Company.</p>
<p>The notice period for an AGM and an EGM to consider any special resolution (a resolution which requires a 75% majority vote, not a simple majority) is 21 days. The Company may call any other general meeting on 14 days’ notice subject to obtaining shareholder authority to do so. The Directors consider that it is in the interests of the Company to retain this flexibility, and intend to seek annually such authority. As a matter of policy, the 14 day notice period will only be utilised where the Directors believe that it is merited by the business of the meeting and the circumstances surrounding the business in question.</p>
<p>In accordance with UK Code recommendations, the Annual Report and the notice of AGM are sent to shareholders at least 20 working days before the AGM.</p>
<p>No business shall be transacted at any general meeting unless a quorum is present at the time when the meeting proceeds to business. Three members present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote shall be a quorum.</p>
<p>Only those shareholders registered on the Company’s register of members at the prescribed record date, being a date not more than 48 hours before the general meeting to which it relates, are entitled to attend and vote at a general meeting.</p>
<p>The Acts require that resolutions of the general meeting be passed by the majority of votes cast (ordinary resolution) unless the Acts or the Company’s Articles of Association provide for 75% majority of votes cast (special resolution). The Company’s Articles of Association provide that the Chairman has a casting vote in the event of a tie.</p>
<p>Any shareholder who is entitled to attend, speak and vote at a general meeting is entitled to appoint a proxy to attend, speak and vote on his or her behalf. A proxy need not be a member of the Company.</p>
<p>At meetings, unless a poll is demanded, all resolutions are determined on a show of hands, with every shareholder who is present in person or by proxy having one vote. On a poll every shareholder who is present in person or by proxy shall have one vote for each share of which he/she is the holder. A shareholder need not cast all votes in the same way. At the meeting, after each resolution has been dealt with, details are given of the level of proxy votes lodged for and against that resolution and also the level of votes withheld on that resolution.</p>
<p>The Company’s AGM gives shareholders the opportunity to question the Directors. The Company must answer any question a member asks relating to the business being dealt with at the meeting unless answering the question would interfere unduly with the preparation for the general meeting or the confidentiality and business interests of the Company, or the answer has already been given on a website in the form of an answer to a question, or it appears to the Chairman of the meeting that it is undesirable in the interests of good order of the meeting that the question be answered.</p>
<p>The business of the Company is managed by the Directors who may exercise all the powers of the Company unless they are required to be exercised by the Company in general meeting. Matters reserved to shareholders in general meeting include the election of directors; the payment of dividends; the appointment of the external auditor; amendments to the Articles of Association; measures to increase or reduce the share capital; and the authority to issue shares.</p>
<!---->
<h2>MEMORANDUM AND ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION</h2>
<p>The Company’s Memorandum of Association sets out the objects and powers of the Company. The Articles of Association detail the rights attaching to each share class; the method by which the Company’s shares can be purchased or reissued; the provisions which apply to the holding of and voting at general meetings; and the rules relating to the Directors, including their appointment, retirement, re-election, duties and powers. Any amendment of the Company’s Articles of Association requires the passing of a special resolution.</p>
<p>Further details in relation to the purchase of the Company’s own shares are included in the <a href="corporate-governance/director-report.html">Directors’ Report</a>.</p>
<!---->
<h2>CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY</h2>
<p>As part of its overall remit of ensuring that effective risk management policies and systems are in place, the Board examines the significance of environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters to the Group’s business and it has ensured that the Group has in place effective systems for managing and mitigating ESG risks. It also examines the impact that such risks may have on the Group’s short and long-term value, as well as the opportunities that ESG issues present to enhance value. The Board receives the necessary information to make this assessment in regular reports from the executive management.</p>
<p>Corporate responsibility is embedded throughout the Group. Group policies and activities are summarised <a href="business-and-strategy/corporate-responsibility.html">here</a> and the Group’s corporate responsibility report is available on the Group’s website <a href="http://www.candcgroupplc.com/about/corporate-responsibility" target="_blank">www.candcgroupplc.com</a>.</p>
<!---->
<h2>INTERNAL CONTROL</h2>
<p>The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system of internal control, for reviewing its effectiveness and for confirming that there is a process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks affecting the achievement of the Group’s strategic objectives. The process which has been in place for the entire period accords with the Turnbull Guidance (revised guidance published in October 2005) and involves the Board considering the following:</p>
<ul class="list">
	<li>the nature and extent of the key risks facing the Group;</li>
	<li>the likelihood of these risks occurring;</li>
	<li>the impact on the Group should these risks occur;</li>
	<li>the actions being taken to manage these risks to the desired level.</li>
</ul>
<p>The key elements of the internal control system in operation are as follows:</p>
<ul class="list">
	<li>clearly defined organisation structures and lines of authority;</li>
	<li>corporate policies for financial reporting, treasury and financial risk management, information technology and security, project appraisal and corporate governance;</li>
	<li>annual budgets for all business units, identifying key risks and opportunities;</li>
	<li>monitoring of performance against budgets on a weekly basis and reporting thereon to the Board on a periodic basis;</li>
	<li>an internal audit function which reviews key business processes and controls; and</li>
	<li>an audit committee which approves plans and deals with significant control issues raised by internal or external audit.</li>
</ul>
<p>This system of internal control can only provide reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss. The terms of reference of the Audit Committee require it to review the adequacy and effectiveness of the Group’s internal financial controls and risk management systems. The risks facing the Group are reviewed regularly by the Audit Committee with the executive management team. Specific annual reviews of the risks and fundamental controls of each business unit are undertaken on an ongoing basis, the results and recommendations of which are reported to and analysed by the Audit Committee with a programme for action agreed by the business units.</p>
<p>The preparation and issue of financial reports, including consolidated annual financial statements is managed by Group Finance with oversight from the Audit Committee. The key features of the Group’s internal control procedures with regard to the preparation of consolidated financial statements are as follows:</p>
<ul class="list">
	<li>the review of each operating division’s period end reporting package by the Group finance function;</li>
	<li>the oversight, review and validation of consolidation journals by the Group Chief Financial Officer;</li>
	<li>the challenge and review of the financial results of each operating division with the management of that division by the Group Chief Financial Officer;</li>
	<li>the review of any internal control weaknesses highlighted by the external auditor, by the Group Chief Financial Officer, Head of Internal Audit and the Audit Committee; and the follow up of any critical weaknesses to ensure issues highlighted are addressed.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Directors confirm that, in addition to the monitoring carried out by the Audit Committee under its terms of reference, they have reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s risk management and internal control systems up to and including the date of approval of the financial statements. This review had regard to all material controls, including financial, operational and compliance controls that could affect the Group’s business. The Directors considered the outcome of this review and found the systems satisfactory.</p>
<!---->
<h2>GOING CONCERN</h2>
<p>The principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group are set out in the report <a href="business-and-strategy/strategic-report.html">here</a>. The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are set out in the <a href="business-and-strategy/cfo-review.html">Group Chief Financial Officer’s Review</a>. A description of the business of the Group is set out in the <a href="business-and-strategy/ceo-review.html">Group Chief Executive Officer’s Review</a> and the <a href="business-and-strategy/operations-review.html">Operations Review</a>.</p>
<p>An explanation of the basis on which the Group generates and preserves value over the longer term (the business model) and the strategy for delivering its objectives are set out in the <a href="business-and-strategy/ceo-review.html">Group Chief Executive Officer’s review</a>. A statement of the Group’s strategy is set out <a href="business-and-strategy/strategic-report.html">here</a>. The Group’s long term strategy is to build a sustainable cider-led multi-beverage business through a combination of organic growth and selective acquisitions. The Group’s business model seeks growth through brand/market combination combining brand investment with a focus on local markets.</p>
<p>The Group has significant revenues, a large number of customers and suppliers across different geographies, and considerable financial resources. For these reasons, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company, and the Group as a whole, have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Consequently they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.</p>
